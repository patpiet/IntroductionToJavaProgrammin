    (Restore objects from a file) Suppose a file named Exercise17_07.dat has been
    created using the ObjectOutputStream. The file contains Loan objects. The
    Loan class in Listing 10.2 does not implement Serializable. Rewrite the
    Loan class to implement Serializable. Write a program that reads the Loan
    objects from the file and displays the total loan amount. Suppose you donâ€™t
    know how many Loan objects are there in the file, use EOFException to end
    the loop.
